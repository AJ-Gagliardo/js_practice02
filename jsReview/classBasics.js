// You are making a class called Fruit. Each fruit has a name (like "apple") and a color (like "red").

/*
Youâ€™re making a Knight class. A knight has a name, and he can be given a Weapon.
A Weapon has a type (e.g., "sword") and a damage value (e.g., 15).
The knight can attack(), which should log something like:

"Sir Bravestone attacks with sword and deals 15 damage!"

ðŸš§ What youâ€™ll need to do:
Create a class Weapon that takes type and damage as parameters.

Create a class Knight that takes name and a weapon object as parameters.

Inside Knight, store the name and weapon in this.name and this.weapon.

Make a method called attack() that prints the sentence using both.

Create a weapon and a knight, and have the knight attack.
